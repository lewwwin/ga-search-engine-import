Search Engine Importer Bookmarklet for Google Analytics

Here you'll find a code for a bookmark in Chrome that will help you import a list of additional organic search engines.

Google Analytics recognizes around 60 of the most popular search engines (https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2795821?hl=en). 
The rest goes to your data as a referral medium. Replace referrals that are search engines in organic.
